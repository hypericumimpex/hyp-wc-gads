== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need to have any online marketing experience to use Kliken? =
Not at all. We have designed Kliken with people that have little to no knowledge of online marketing in mind. We take care of all the technical stuff while you sit back and watch as the customers roll into your online store.

= How does Kliken get me found on search engines? =
Kliken will automatically generate a campaign for your store and display it on Google search results. To sign up, all you have to do is go through our campaign build process that takes as little as  5 minutes. After that is done, we take care of the rest and will continually update you on the status of your campaign.

As customers search for your products on Google, Google will match your products name and descriptions to those searches. Your ads only show to people searching for your products, and will send those visitors directly to your product's page.

Yes. Our plugin makes it just that!
